/* ==== Challenge 1: ====
  - Create a variable named `name`
  - Assign it's value to your first and last name 
  - Does this variable need to be a constant? It depends completely on you! It should be a const variable IF you intend to never change your name.
*/

// code for `name` goes here
const name = 'Cameron Morgan';

/* ==== Challenge 2: ====
  - Create a variable called `age`
  - UNLESS you've descovered a very important secret in life, you should  probably allow for `mutability` here.
*/

// code for `age` goes here
let age = 34;


/* ==== Challenge 3: ====
  - Create a variable called `myLocation`
  - Base the value on where you're currently sitting. Consider if this is something that could change eventually.
*/

// code for `myLocation` goes here
let myLocation = 'California';


/* ==== Challenge 4: ====
  - Create a variable called `faveBook` 
  - Consider if this is some data about yourself that could change.
*/

// code for `faveBook` goes here
let faveBook = 'Hyperion'

/* ==== Challenge 5: ====
  - Create a variable called `faveBand` 
  - Consider if this is some data about yourself that could change.
*/

// code for `faveBand` goes here
let faveBand = 'Alexisonfire'

/* ==== Challenge 6: ====
  - Problem create a variable called `faveFood` 
  - Consider if this is some data about yourself that could change.
*/

// code for `faveFood` goes here
let faveFood = 'Steak'

/* ==== Challenge 7: ====
  - Look at the function declaration named `example` below
  - Comment `block scope` where you see block scope
  - Comment `function scope` where you see function scope
*/

function example() {
  // function scope + block scope
  if (true) {
    // block scope
